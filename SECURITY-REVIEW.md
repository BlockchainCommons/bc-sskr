# Security Review for `bc-shamir` and `bc-sskr`

Our `bc-shamir` and `bc-sskr` libraries have been reviewed by [Radically Open Security](https://radicallyopensecurity.com/) thanks to funding by our sustaining patron [Bitmark](https://bitmark.com/). We are currently awaiting final approval to release that report due to a disclosure that affects another industry member.

In the future, this page will include a link to the open report and our own comments on the report, including our resultant fixes (already incorporated into the code) and our thoughts on a few findings that we have left open.
