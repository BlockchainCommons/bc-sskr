# ðŸ”‘ Blockchain Commons SSKR

### _by [Wolf McNally](https://www.github.com/wolfmcnally) and [Christopher Allen](https://www.github.com/ChristopherA)_

* <img src="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/images/logos/crypto-commons-super-simple.png" width=16 valign="bottom">&nbsp;&nbsp; ***part of the [crypto commons](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/README.md) technology family***

**Blockchain Commons SSKR** is an implementation of [Sharded Secret Key Reconstruction (SSKR)](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-011-sskr.md) for use in [Blockchain Commons](https://www.BlockchainCommons.com) Software Projects.

## Prerequisites

* If [`bc-crypto-base`](https://github.com/blockchaincommons/bc-crypto-base) is not installed, the `configure` step below will fail.
* If [`bc-shamir`](https://github.com/blockchaincommons/bc-shamir) is not installed, the `configure` step below will fail.

## Installation Instructions

### MacOS and Linux

```bash
$ ./configure
$ make check
$ sudo make install
```

This sequence runs the module's unit tests.

### WebAssembly

> **Warning:** This is an experimental feature!

1. Install and activate Emscripten: https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html
2. After setting up the environment variables for the toolchain
`$ source $HOME/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh`
 run `./build-wasm.sh`. This will build the wasm/`sskr.wasm` and wasm/`sskr.js` files
3. cd into wasm and run `./start-server.sh` and navigate to http://localhost:8888/sskr.html
4.    You can edit `sskr.html`, save and refresh browser

## Usage Instructions

1. Link against `libbc-sskr.a`, `libbc-shamir.a` and `libbc-crypto-base.a`.
2. Include the umbrella header in your code:

```c
#include <bc-sskr/bc-sskr.h>
```

## Design Notes

The Blockchain Commons implementation of Shamir's Secret Sharing makes a decision to incorporate fragments of the hashed secret to reduce complexity and share size for sharding, and to allow the detection of malicious shares, but it comes at the cost of reducing the Information-Theoretic Security of Shamir's Secret Sharing to Computational Security.This was a thoughtful and purposeful decision that has also been adopted by others in the industry. We believe that it offers advantages to the secret-sharing scheme while maintaining a level of security congruent with any services that `bc-sskr` is likely to be used with, such as Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Read [the SSKR security review](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr/blob/master/SECURITY-REVIEW.md#1-bc-shamir-provides-only-computational-security-btm-019) for more information. 

## Maintainer Notes

Before accepting a PR that can affect build or unit tests, make sure the following sequence of commands succeeds:

```bash
$ ./configure
$ make lint
$ make distcheck
$ make distclean
```

`make lint` uses [Cppcheck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cppcheck) to perform static analysis on the code. All PRs should pass with no warnings.

`make distcheck` builds a distribution tarball, unpacks it, then configures, builds, and runs unit tests from it, then performs an install and uninstall from a non-system directory and makes sure the uninstall leaves it clean. `make distclean` removes all known byproduct files, and unless you've added files of your own, should leave the directory in a state that could be tarballed for distribution. After a `make distclean` you'll have to run `./configure` again.
