# ðŸ”‘ Blockchain Commons SSKR

### _by [Wolf McNally](https://www.github.com/wolfmcnally) and [Christopher Allen](https://www.github.com/ChristopherA)_

* <img src="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/images/logos/crypto-commons-super-simple.png" width=16 valign="bottom">&nbsp;&nbsp; ***part of the [crypto commons](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/README.md) technology family***

**Blockchain Commons SSKR** is an implementation of [Sharded Secret Key Reconstruction (SSKR)](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-011-sskr.md) for use in [Blockchain Commons](https://www.BlockchainCommons.com) Software Projects.

## Prerequisites

* If [`bc-crypto-base`](https://github.com/blockchaincommons/bc-crypto-base) is not installed, the `configure` step below will fail.
* If [`bc-shamir`](https://github.com/blockchaincommons/bc-shamir) is not installed, the `configure` step below will fail.

## Installation Instructions

```bash
$ ./configure
$ make check
$ sudo make install
```

This sequence runs the module's unit tests.

## Usage Instructions

1. Link against `libbc-sskr.a`, `libbc-shamir.a` and `libbc-crypto-base.a`.
2. Include the umbrella header in your code:

```c
#include <bc-sskr/bc-sskr.h>
```

## Notes for Maintainers

Before accepting a PR that can affect build or unit tests, make sure the following sequence of commands succeeds:

```bash
$ ./configure
$ make lint
$ make distcheck
$ make distclean
```

`make lint` uses [Cppcheck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cppcheck) to perform static analysis on the code. All PRs should pass with no warnings.

`make distcheck` builds a distribution tarball, unpacks it, then configures, builds, and runs unit tests from it, then performs an install and uninstall from a non-system directory and makes sure the uninstall leaves it clean. `make distclean` removes all known byproduct files, and unless you've added files of your own, should leave the directory in a state that could be tarballed for distribution. After a `make distclean` you'll have to run `./configure` again.

### Used withâ€¦

These are other projects that work with or leverage bc-sskr:

- [Gordian Guardian](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianGuardian-iOS) â€” iPhone app for storing cryptographic seeds.
- [LetheKit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lethekit) â€” Open source DIY hardware box for offline cryptographic tools.
- [seedtool](https://github.com/blockchaincommons/bc-seedtool-cli) â€”Â Tool for generating and transforming cryptographic seeds.

### Derived fromâ€¦

bc-sskr project is either derived from or was inspired by:

- [SLIP-39](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0039.md): Shamir's Secret-Sharing for Mnemonic Codes

### Dependencies

To build the bc-sskr you'll need to use the following tools:

- autotools - Gnu Build System from Free Software Foundation ([intro](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Autotools-Introduction.html)).
- [`bc-crypto-base`](https://github.com/blockchaincommons/bc-crypto-base) - base cryptography library
- [`bc-shamir`](https://github.com/blockchaincommons/bc-shamir) - Shamir's Secret Sharing library

### Discussions

The best place to talk about Blockchain Commons and its projects is in our GitHub Discussions areas.

[**Wallet Standard Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning/discussions). For standards and open-source developers who want to talk about wallet standards, please use the Discussions area of the [Airgapped Signing repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning). This is where you can talk about projects like our [LetheKit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lethekit) and command line tools such as [seedtool](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-seedtool-cli), both of which are intended to testbed wallet technologies, plus the libraries that we've built to support your own deployment of wallet technology such as [bc-bip39](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-bip39), [bc-slip39](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-slip39), [bc-shamir](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-shamir), [Sharded Secret Key Reconstruction](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr), [bc-ur](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-ur), and the [bc-crypto-base](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-crypto-base). If it's a wallet-focused technology or a more general discussion of wallet standards,discuss it here.

[**Blockchain Commons Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/discussions). For developers, interns, and patrons of Blockchain Commons, please use the discussions area of the [Community repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community) to talk about general Blockchain Commons issues, the intern program, or topics other than the [Gordian System](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/discussions) or the [wallet standards](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning/discussions), each of which have their own discussion areas.

### Other Questions & Problems

## Responsible Disclosure

We want to keep all our software safe for everyone. If you have discovered a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner. We are unfortunately not able to offer bug bounties at this time.

We do ask that you offer us good faith and use best efforts not to leak information or harm any user, their data, or our developer community. Please give us a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue before you publish it. Do not defraud our users or us in the process of discovery. We promise not to bring legal action against researchers who point out a problem provided they do their best to follow the these guidelines.

### Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected security vulnerabilities in private via email to ChristopherA@BlockchainCommons.com (do not use this email for support). Please do NOT create publicly viewable issues for suspected security vulnerabilities.

The following keys may be used to communicate sensitive information to developers:

| Name              | Fingerprint                                        |
